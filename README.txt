# MathOfTheDead

Group 10

Math Of The Dead, an interactive brain game being developed by NGU (Never Give Up). Our team includes Andrew Busto, Maks Fisli, Rachel Shellborn, Shane Jackson, and Vincent Lam.
This short manual will guide you through the concept and features of Math Of The Dead. NGU has designed this game to increase your mental math skills in a fun and unique way. The basis of the game is to use mathematical operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) to bring down an oncoming hoard of zombies.

Each of our pages is in a separate html file, which you will find in the general section of our folder.  We organize all other elements into sub-folders.  We are using Javascript for nearly all game logic, CSS for styling, and mongoDB (specifically mLab) for the leaderboard database.

Feel free to test our game here:
